# Neural-Network-for-Predicting-Housing-Prices-Based-on-Number-of-Bedrooms

# Instructions:
Tasks performed in the provided code:

1. **Define Training Data**:
   - Define input data `xs` representing the number of bedrooms.
   - Define target data `ys` representing the corresponding house prices.

2. **Model Creation and Compilation**:
   - Create a sequential model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
   - Add a Dense layer with 1 unit, representing the output layer.
   - Compile the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model on the defined training data (`xs` and `ys`) for 1000 epochs.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions for a new data point representing the number of bedrooms in a house (e.g., 7 bedrooms).
   - Print the predicted house price based on the given number of bedrooms.

5. **Repeating Model Definition, Compilation, Training, and Prediction**:
   - Define a function `house_model` that encapsulates the process of model definition, compilation, training, and prediction.
   - Define new data points for prediction (`x_new`).
   - Use the `house_model` function to train the model and make predictions for the new data points.
